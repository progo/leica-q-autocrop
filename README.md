# leica-q-autocrop

Leica Q allows one to frame pictures in full 28 mm view, or crop in 35
mm or 50 mm equivalent. These crop instructions are stored in DNG
files but Darktable as of now doesn't run them. This lua script will
make the crops automatically, provided you create the crop styles
yourself.

See instructions in the file header.
